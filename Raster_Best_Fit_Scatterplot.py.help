Script uses four regression method for analysis:\n- linear regression\n- logarithmic regression\n- exponential regression\n- power regression\nMethod selection is automatic and it is based on the best result of regression analysis (the highest regression coefficient)\nRasters used for analysis should have the same spatial pattern (size and number of pixels).", "Use_mask": "Selection of mask usage.
